# campan
Campan is a project that was supposed to help my colleagues in my work to learn new recipes that will be added for a certain period as a limited edition, the project was popular, but in the end the management marked it as useless, for this reason the project is a usable state, but I will not solve many ideas that I still wanted to put in and I will try to invest time in something more productive.
# music and sound
Sounds and music are set to path from my computer.. Maybe I'll rewrite it myself, although I don't suppose anyone will try to use it, but if by chance I need to rewrite the beginning of the way.
Stuffs (folder) --> Sounds.java (class)
